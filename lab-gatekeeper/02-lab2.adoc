[Abstract]
In this use case we are going to verify that every service, route and deployment match the same labels as part of the deployment process.
As we are testing different kinds of resources like Deployment, Route and Service, we are going to deploy different constraints. Furthermore we are going to exclude a namespace to see how to implement this functionality.

== Deploy Config

== Deploy Constraint Template

== Deploy Constraint 

== Positive test
