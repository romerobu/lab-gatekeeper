:toc-title: Required route name

[Abstract]

In this use case we are going to verify that the route name follows the required pattern to validate it.

For this example we are going to apply this constraint over two different projects, `petclinic-bluegreen-$USER` which is the production environment and `petclinic-beta-$USER` which is the development environment. 

Previously we are going to create a `Config` resource to exclude `webhook` process from `petclinic-beta-$USER` project so we will be able to create non valid resources but those violations will be registered on the status.

:numbered:
== Deploy constraint

=== Deploy Config

As mentioned we need to create a config resource to exclude some processes from a namespace, `webhook` for `petclinic-beta-$USER`. This is a cluster wide resource which should be created by an user with cluster-admin privileges so you can check the existing resource with this command:

*CLI*:

----
oc get config.config.gatekeeper.sh/config -o yaml -n openshift-gatekeeper-system
----

*Web Console*:

Go to `Explore`, search for `Config`, then on the upper banner select `openshift-gatekeeper-system` namespace ans select your instance.

Finally you will be able to see the yaml definition:

image:configinstance.png[configinstance]

You will see there is a list of namespaces excluded for webhook process, this is because it centralizes the configuration for all the users in this lab.


=== Deploy Constraint Template

First we need to deploy the constraint templates where we are going to check the existing name of the object under test.

*CLI*: 

----
oc apply -f lab-gatekeeper-files/lab3/constraintTemplate.yaml
----

If you take a look to this template, you will see in this case you are using `contains` verification.

----
apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: ConstraintTemplate
metadata:
  name: requiredroutename
spec:
  crd:
    spec:
      names:
        kind: RequiredRouteName
      validation:
        # Schema for the `parameters` field
        openAPIV3Schema:
          properties:
            name:
              type: string
  targets:
    - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh
      rego: |
        package requiredroutename
        violation[{"msg": msg}] {
          provided := input.review.object.metadata.name
          required := input.parameters.name
          not contains(provided,required)
          msg := sprintf("Route must include string: %v", [required])
        }
----

*Web Console*:

Go to `Home` -> `Explore` -> Type `ConstraintTemplate` -> Select `v1beta1` version.

Once you have selected `ConstraintTemplate` you will navigate to a page where you see the resource details.

Go to `Instances` tab and click on `Create ConstraintTemplate`, then paste the yaml definition:

----
apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: ConstraintTemplate
metadata:
  name: requiredroutename
spec:
  crd:
    spec:
      names:
        kind: RequiredRouteName
      validation:
        # Schema for the `parameters` field
        openAPIV3Schema:
          properties:
            name:
              type: string
  targets:
    - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh
      rego: |
        package requiredroutename
        violation[{"msg": msg}] {
          provided := input.review.object.metadata.name
          required := input.parameters.name
          not contains(provided,required)
          msg := sprintf("Route must include string: %v", [required])
        }
----


=== Deploy Constraint 

Additionally we need to deploy the constraints where we are going to limit the impact to `petclinic-bluegreen-$USER` and `petclinic-beta-$USER`  namespace and specify the required name.

For this example parameters are:

- Namespace where the rule is implemented: `petclinic-bluegreen-$USER` and `petclinic-beta-$USER`.
- Resource under test: `Route`.
- Required name: `route-petclinic-bluegreen`.
- Enforcement action: `deny`.

*CLI*:

----
oc process -f lab-gatekeeper-files/lab3/constraint.yaml -p USER=$USER  | oc apply -f -
----

*Web Console*:

After creating the instance you should see the recently created resource in a list. Then as per your yaml definition you should be able to list a  CRD called `RequiredRouteName` in the main menu.

Repeat the same procedure for this new CRD and paste your yaml definition after changing the ${USER} value for your username:

WARNING: It may take a while till those are listed.

----
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: RequiredRouteName
metadata:
  name: required-route-name
spec:
  enforcementAction: deny      
  match:
    namespaces:
      - "petclinic-bluegreen-${USER}"     
      - "petclinic-beta-${USER}"  
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: ["*"]
        kinds: ["Route"]
  parameters:
    name: route-petclinic-bluegreen
----


== Test constraint


=== Test negative case

In this lab we are going to test how constraint applies to existing resources from the last exercise. For this test we are going to check the status of the constraint as the existing route's name doesn't fulfil the requirements.

*CLI*:

----
oc get requiredroutename.constraints.gatekeeper.sh/required-route-name -o yaml
----

*Web Console*:

Navigate to your constraint resource, select your instance and take a look at the status section at `Yaml` tab:

image:statusroute.png[statusroute]

As you can see there is a violation detected for resource `Route`  with error message `Route must include string: route-petclinic-bluegreen`.

For the second namespace `petclinic-beta-$USER` as webhook process is excluded if we try to deploy the same app we should be allowed but getting the same violation warning, so total violations count will be 2.

----
oc apply -f  lab-gatekeeper-files/lab2/deploy-app-green.yaml -n petclinic-beta-$USER
----

=== Test positive case

As the existing route's name is not valid we are going to redeploy it for a valid format so there will be no violation alert.

*CLI*:

----
oc delete all --selector app=quarkus-petclinic-blue -n petclinic-bluegreen-$USER
oc delete all --selector gatekeeper=quarkus-petclinic-green -n petclinic-beta-$USER
oc apply -f lab-gatekeeper-files/lab3/deploy-app-blue.yaml -n petclinic-bluegreen-$USER
----

After waiting the audit interval time there should not be any violation on the constraint.

----
oc get requiredroutename.constraints.gatekeeper.sh/required-route-name -o yaml
----

To finish this lab, delete all the resources:

----
oc delete all --selector app=quarkus-petclinic-blue  -n petclinic-bluegreen-$USER
----


*Web Console*:

First you need to delete manually the existing resources:

Go to `Workloads` and `Deployments`. Select `petclinic-bluegreen-$USER` namespace and delete the deployment containint the label `app=quarkus-petclinic-blue`. Now change namespace to `petclinic-beta-$USER` and delete the deployment containing the label `gatekeeper=quarkus-petclinic-green`.

Once your namespaces are empty deploy these reources as in the previous labs in namespace `petclinic-bluegreen-$USER`:
